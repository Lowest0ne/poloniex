# Poloniex

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/poloniex.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/poloniex)

This gem provides a ruby wrapper to the poloniex.com api: [Link](https://poloniex.com/api)
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'poloniex'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install poloniex

## Usage

All methods provided by ```Poloniex``` are class methods, and are of the same name as the api ( except that "return"s have been removed ).

For example, ```https://www.poloniex.com/public?command=returnTicker``` is written as ```Poloniex.ticker```

The Poloniex module accepts a setup block for configuration:

```
Poloniex.setup do | config |
    config.key = 'my api key'
    config.secret = 'my secret token'
end
```

GET requests ( to /public ) do not need authentication, and therefor do not need Poloniex to be configured.

POST requests ( to /tradingApi ) will need authentication, and you will have to have your own key and secret token.

### Points to be aware when using the API

* By default only the last 500 entries lending_history items since the beginning of the unix timestamp to the current time will be downloaded
* trade_history will download ever trace since the beginning of the unix timestamp to the current time
* deposits_withdrawls will download everthing since the beginning of the unix timestamp to the current time
